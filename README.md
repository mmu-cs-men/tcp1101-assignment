# TCP1101 Assignment
This repo houses code for our Programming Fundamentals assignment.

## Code Guidelines
Below are some guidelines that you should follow to ensure clean and maintainable code.

### 1. Naming Conventions
Use clear and descriptive names. Variables should use "camelCase" and classes should use "PascalCase".

### 2. Code Formatting
Ensure your code is formatted according to the "Visual Studio" style. This is the default for the C++ extension for VSCode.

### 3. Line Length
Try not to write super long lines. If you can, break it up into smaller chunks or simply use the next line.

### 4. Single Responsibility
Each class and function should perform only one function.

### 5. Document Code
Add documentation to every single class and function that you create (except for constructors).
